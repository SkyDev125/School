                        RWBY is an American anime-styled animated web series and media franchise created by Monty Oum for Rooster Teeth. It is set in the fictional world of Remnant, where young people train to become warriors (called "Huntsmen" and "Huntresses") to protect their world from monsters called Grimm. The name RWBY is derived from the four main characters' forenames: Ruby, Weiss, Blake and Yang, as well as their associated theme colors; Red, White, Black and Yellow, and their combined team name: Team RWBY.
